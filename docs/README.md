# Farkle Rules

> On a player's turn, they roll all six dice and check to see if they have rolled any scoring dice or combinations. 
>
> Any dice that score may be set aside and then the player may choose to roll all the remaining dice. 
>
> The player must set aside at least one scoring die of their choice if possible but they are not required to set aside all scoring dice.
> 
> For example, if a player rolled 1-2-2-5-5-6 on their turn, they could set aside the 1 and the two 5's, 
> or they could choose to set aside only the two 5's, or only a single 5, or only the 1.
>
> Any scoring dice that are not set aside may be rerolled along with the non-scoring dice.
> 
> If all six dice have been set aside for scoring (known as having "hot dice"), 
> the player can choose to roll all six dice again and continue adding to their accumulated score 
> or they can bank their points, end their turn, and pass the dice to the next player.
> 
> A player’s turn continues until either they decide to stop (at which point they then score their accumulated points) 
> or until they fail to roll any scoring dice on a throw.
> 
> If a player scores no points on a roll, this is known as a Farkle. The player may continue to roll any dice that have not 
> been previously set aside for scoring, but all of their points gained so far that turn are lost.
> 
> The first player to score a total of 10,000 or more points on their turn wins.
